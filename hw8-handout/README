Tiny Web server with Range support

This is the home directory for the Tiny server, a web server used in 
the textbook CSAPP3e. Tiny uses the GET method to serve static content
(text, HTML, GIF, JPG, mp3, mp4 files) out of ./ (working directory)
and to serve dynamic content by running CGI programs out of ./cgi-bin.
The default page is home.html (rather than index.html) so that we can
view the contents of the directory from a browser.

Tiny is neither secure nor complete, but it gives students an idea of
how a real Web Server works. Use for instructional purposes only.

The compiles and runs cleanly on W204 machines or Vagrant that has Centos6.10
instsalled, running Linux kernel 2.6.32 and gcc version 4.4.7.

To compile Tiny:
  Type "make"

To run Tiny:
  Type "tiny <port>" on the server machine,
    e.g. "tiny 8080".
  Point your browser at Tiny:
    static content: http://<host>:8080
    dynamic content: http://<host>:8080/cgi-bin/adder?1&2

For debugging purposes, you should consider using command line browser curl.
It has options (-v for verbose) where it will print out debugging
info about the connections it makes to the server, the request headers it
sends to the server and the response headers it receives from the webserver. 
  curl -v http://<host>:8080
